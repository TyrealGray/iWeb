### Docs

#### small issue
`Coming Soon` template is not show background picture in iWeb, I guess it is because of app's permission

Didn't implement `<a>` tag url changing feature because of basically it's the same logic as changing `<a>` content

Not support Linux, but it is very likely could be supported
